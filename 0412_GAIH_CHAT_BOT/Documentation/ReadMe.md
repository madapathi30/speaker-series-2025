## 🔗 4. Modular Design

> "Now that we’ve seen how the project is structured, let’s talk about why it's structured that way—this brings us to the concept of Modular   Design."

## ✳ What is Modular Design?

>   "Modular design means breaking down the application into independent, manageable parts—called modules. Each module is responsible for a  specific functionality, and together they form the complete app."

### 4.1. Benefits of Modular Design

#### Separation of Concerns
> "We divide the app into three major concerns: Views, APIs, and Database.
> 1. Views (views/home.py) handle rendering HTML pages .
> 1. APIs (api/chat.py) handle JSON-based requests.
> 1. Database (data/models.py) stores chat history.

#### Easier Debugging & Maintenance

> 1. The app is structured into clear, self-contained components.
> 1. A bug in one module doesn’t affect the others.

#### Scalability

> 1. We can easily add new blueprints (e.g., Authentication, Admin Panel).
> 1. Supports microservices or external APIs without modifying the entire application.

#### Reusability

> 1. Components like views, API routes, and database models can be reused in different projects.


## 📌 5. App Initialization

### 5.1. What Is an App Factory?

> An app factory is a function (commonly named create_app()) that sets up and returns a fully configured Flask application instance. This pattern allows you to configure your application dynamically, register blueprints (which help separate different parts of your app), and initialize extensions (like SQLAlchemy) all in one place.

### 5.2. Role of app.py

> app.py serves as the entry point of your application. Its main job is to call the app factory and start the server. This keeps the configuration logic (like registering blueprints, setting up the database, and loading environment variables) separate from the code that actually runs the server.

📝 app.py

    ```python

                from website import create_app

                app = create_app()

                if __name__ == '__main__':
                    app.run(debug=True)
    ```

## 🔍 What happens in create_app()?

"We configure the app, set the database URI, and then register two main blueprints:

>    - views for rendering HTML templates

>    - api for handling backend logic and interacting with OpenAI"

## 📌 6. Blueprint Structure

## 💡 What is a Blueprint?

"A Blueprint is like a mini-app. You can register it with the main app and it contains its own routes and logic."

## 🧭 We’ve got two main blueprints:
> - 1️⃣ Views Blueprint (views/home.py)
> - 2️⃣ API Blueprint (api/chat.py)

### 6.1. Main App Initialization (website/init.py)

This file is the central place where the Flask application is created. It configures the app, initializes extensions (like SQLAlchemy), and registers the blueprints from both the views and API modules.

📝 website/__init__.py

    ```python

                def create_app():
                    app = Flask(__name__)
                    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "sqlite:///database.db"

                    from .views import views
                    from .api import api
                    app.register_blueprint(views, url_prefix="/")
                    app.register_blueprint(api, url_prefix="/api")

                    return app
    ```


#### 6.1.1. Key Points

> 1. Loads environment variables.
> 1. Configures app settings (secret key, database URI, etc.).
> 1. Initializes the database.
> 1. Registers two major blueprints
>    - Views Blueprint: For routes that render HTML templates.
>    - API Blueprint: For endpoints that return JSON responses.

### 6.2. View Routes (website/views/home.py)

This module contains routes responsible for rendering HTML templates. They handle user navigation and display pages such as Home, Single Turn Chat Bot, and Search History.

📂 website/views/home.py

    ```python

                from flask import Blueprint, render_template

                views = Blueprint("views", __name__)

                @views.route("/")
                def home():
                    return render_template("home.html")
    ```


#### 6.2.1. Key Points

> 1. Defines a blueprint named views.
> 1. Contains routes like /, /stchatbot, and /history.
> 1. Each route calls render_template() to display the appropriate page.

### 6.3. API Endpoints (website/api/chat.py)

This module contains endpoints that interact with external services (like OpenAI) and return JSON responses. In this case, the /api/chat endpoint receives a user message, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns the bot's response.


📂 website/api/chat.py

    ```python

                from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
                import openai

                api = Blueprint("api", __name__)

                @api.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
                def chat():
                    data = request.get_json()
                    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": data["message"]}],
                    )
                    return jsonify({"response": response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]})
    ```


#### 6.3.1. Key Points

> 1. Defines a blueprint named api.
> 1. Contains the /chat route for handling POST requests.
> 1. Processes JSON data, validates input, calls the OpenAI API, and returns a JSON response.

## 🔑 Final Thoughts:
"Blueprints help us separate logic clearly. If we want to add more features—like authentication or analytics—we can just plug in new blueprints without rewriting existing logic."

## ▶ 7. Running the App and show Navigation

> Now that the setup is complete, you can run the app and explore its navigation structure.From your terminal, simply run:

    ```python
            python app.py
    ```        


> Once the server is up and running, head to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.You’ll find three main routes available:


- /  — Home Page

- /stchatbot — Chat Interface

- /history — History Page (This can be expanded to show past chat sessions)

## 💬 8. Showing the Chat Interface in Action

> Navigate to the /stchatbot route and try sending a message — for example:

 ```python
    What is modular design in Flask?
```


> Here’s what happens under the hood: Your message is sent to the /api/chat endpoint via a POST request.

That endpoint:

- Processes your input  
- Sends it to OpenAI's API 
- Receives the response

> The chatbot UI then updates instantly with the AI’s reply.

> Tech Stack Highlights:

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

- Backend: Flask + OpenAI API
